I will use the Zwillo API data for my own personal use.  I am testing out mashing the data up with other open datasources like crime 
stats, school boundaries, and environmental quality reports.  Front-end will be an instance of splunk with developer license, and I will abide by all the terms in the API Branding requirements and other requirements as documented or directed by Zwillo.

Thank you for your consideration.
